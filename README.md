# Uncommon VHDL Bug: Incorrect Signal Initialization

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet impactful bug in VHDL code related to incorrect signal initialization.  Improper initialization of internal signals can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues, particularly in designs involving asynchronous inputs or intricate state machines.

The `bug.vhdl` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.vhdl` provides the corrected version.  The problem stems from initializing the `internal_data` signal to an undefined value ('X').  This can result in unexpected outputs during the first clock cycle.

**Key Learning:** Always explicitly initialize signals with a known, valid value in VHDL to avoid potential issues and ensure predictable behavior.
